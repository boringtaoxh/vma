The name Finlay means ‘Ray of Sunlight’ in Gaelic and the essence of the brand is to capture that rare, magical moment of glorious sunshine.

Classically British and inspired by the tradition but with character and with a touch of luxury. Finlay & Co. designs, manufactures and distributes quality wooden sunglasses. Inspired by the designs in 1950s, Finlay & Co.’s sunglasses are all hand made to achieve optimum comfort across the collection. With two classic designs of sunglasses available in a choice of three different woods, each pair of glasses is unique, individual in its own grain, character, and natural finish. 

Established by an ex-banker from Barclays along with his buddies, Finlay & Co. dedicated to the notion of creating iconic sunglasses. Now, less than three years later, the brand has been one of the hottest in the fashion world and the company’s products are being worn by such luminaries as supermodel David Gandy, F1 star Jenson Button and Pippa Middleton.
