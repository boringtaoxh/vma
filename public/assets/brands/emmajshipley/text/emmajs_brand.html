<p>Emma J Shipley's graphic designs are inspired by the irregular pattern's and unique beauty in nature, exploring surreal fantasy, imagination and evolution. Travel is also a huge inspiration, and recent collections have been inspired by trips to the Amazon jungle, a South African safari and a Scottish Highlands hike. Each artwork is intricately hand drawn in pencil, before being printed onto the finest fabrics and handmade in Italy. <br />
