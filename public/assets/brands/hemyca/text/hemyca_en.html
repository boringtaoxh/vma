Lady with AttitudeHEMYCA is a luxury women¡¯s wear label based in London. HEMYCA is positioned as a pioneer in the fusion of digital media and fashion, harnessing innovative technologies to enhance their collections on both a conceptual and experiential level. The HEMYCA collection weaves timelessness with a distinctive contemporary edge, exploring structural silhouettes, contrast and strength through precision tailoring and exceptional detailing and quality. Co-founders Helen Clinch and Myra Nigris met whilst studying at the London College of Fashion through a shared passion and devotion to the art of luxury fashion design; a tradition passed down through both families, with Helen¡¯s family working in Savile Row and Myra¡¯s family in their atelier in Italy. In 2009, after training with noted designers Roland Mouret and Ben de Lisi, Helen and Myra launched the HEMYCA brand with a vision of creating a globally recognised fashion brand synonymous with innovative design, luxury and elegance. HEMYCA has grown steadily in recent years, gaining momentum and recognition within the luxury fashion world and has dressed many celebrities including: Olivia Colman, Donna Air, Taylor Swift, Cheryl Cole, Dame Kelly Holmes and Nicole Scherzinger. The brand is well-known for its collaborative work with charities including Age UK, Breast Cancer Campaign and The Elephant Family. The HEMYCA ready to wear line is currently stocked internationally and is also available online. HEMYCA Bespoke and Bridal is available, by appointment, at the London studio.
